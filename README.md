# 3D Gaussian Splatting Blender Addon

**Sponsored by [BricksAR](https://www.bricksar.com): Build a LEGO city in AR**

## Disclaimer
This add-on was developed mostly as an experimentation, it is slow on large scenes, and not fully accurate. It can be used as a tool to clean floaters in Gaussian Splatting captures.

In order to be faster in non-pointcloud mode, it would be needed to implement gaussians as camera-facing quads, as some implementations for other engines have done.

## Install
In the top right corner, press Code > Download zip. In blender, go to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install and find your zip. Once installed, enable it and find it in the sidebar.
